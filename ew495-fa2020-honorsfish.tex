\begin{abstract}
High $L/D$ unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) are typically optimized for ahead propulsion and do not maneuver well in confined environments or during launch and recovery.  We are developing \textbf{``pop-out'' bioinspired flapping foil auxiliary propulsion} for UUVs based on \textbf{fish locomotion} in the \emph{Tetraodontiformes}, including pufferfish, triggerfish, and \emph{Mola mola}, the ocean sunfish.  This group uses median/paired fins (MPF), other than the caudal fin, to accomplish maneuvers in forward and lateral directions seamlessly.  During fall 2020, our efforts have developed an idealized 2D model of flapping, to guide early design, as well as initial hardware for hydrodynamic testing. In spring 2021, we plan to demonstrate bio-inspired flapping fins on a high $L/D$, cylindrical midbody shape, to test potential improvements in low speed maneuverability.

\begin{itemize}
\item Assume low advance ratio $J$
\item Obtain relative velocity and $\alpha$
\item Use empirical $C_L$, $C_D$
\item Rotate resultant forces to vehicle coordinates
\item Create a map of force for foil sway $v$, angle $\psi$
\end{itemize}


\subsection{3-axis test rig}
The tethered test rig will be implemented next semester.  Utilizing the SURF in Hopper Hall, hardware experimentation will occur.  The goal of the test rig is to create a foil pattern for desired motion of the unmanned underwater vehicle.  Various phase angles will be tested to produce the desired angular movement of the UUV for low speed maneuverability.  Additionally, the results from experimentation will result in the compilation of a blending algorithm for seamless operation at low speed.  The algorithm will incorporate horizontal and vertical movement to ensure 3-axis functionality.  The ultimate goal is for the blending algorithm and the phase angle pattern is to enable low speed maneuverability of the UUV.  Low speed maneuverability enables recovery of UUVs and improved functionality in confined environments.  

\subsection{Modeling of the base UUV}
% If you want to use a figure provide me with .png or .jpg or whatever and I can put it in. For a table put it in comments and I can format for you. _____ please attach some sketches from the folder, no need for a table
The elementary version of the UUV will be a 4 inch diameter PVC pipe.  The pipe will be capped at the ends.  Utilizing blue foam, the fundamental UUV will be neutrally buoyant in water.  Neutral buoyancy will also need to incorporate the density of the servo motors and the Tetrix pieces used.  3D printed fish fins will attach to the UUV body by pieces of a Tetrix kit.  The Tetrix pieces will be attached to a servo motor to enable the fins to reach a desired phase angle for experimentation.  For the recreated fish fins, the current intention is to utilize resin printing to allow for flexibility in the fins to better mimic that found in fish.  The fin structure will be that of an ocean sunfish ("mola mola") or a triggerfish. 
 
\subsection{Actuator designs}
% Do you want me to use your sketches from your poster directory?
include sketches from poster please
Servo actuators will attach to the body of the UUV.  The actuators are connected to the fins by Tetrix pieces.  The fins will passively pop out and adjust its angular position to the desired phase angle sent to the servo.  Servos will receive desired angles from the mbed or raspberry pi to move the position of the fins to the phase angle.  

\section{Methods and materials}
\subsection{Toy model}
Evangelista will copy from poster
\subsection{3-axis test rig}
The test rig will have a tethered power source.  This power source will also eliminate the need to hardcode the mbed or raspberry pi.  A tether power source will simplify data collection and streamline the experimentation process in order to complete more testing to obtain a larger pool of results.  Waterproof servos will attach to the UUV body.  Communicating using the raspberry pi or mbed, the servo will move the fish fin to the desired phase angle and the ensuing motion will be recorded via accelerometers and video footage.  The video will be analyzed in Matlab via the DLTviewer application.  To simplify testing, the rig will focus on a single plane.  Once mastery is achieved over a single plane, another plane will become the focus.  As experimentation of each plane is completed, results will be blended to create the algoithm motion.  Completed results will be analyzed to to identify the foil pattern for desired motion of the UUV.

\section{Results}
\subsection{Toy model}

\subsection{3-axis test rig}
There are no current results from the 3-axis test rig.  The intention is to get into the Hopper Hall SURF early in the spring to begin test rig.  Results for the test rig come in the form of 3D printed fins.  Due to COVID-19 restrictions, limited progress could be made in 3D printing fins.  Additionally, there was a need to relearn using Autodesk and Makerbot.  An elementary fin was printed, but details of dimensions need refined.  Moreover, the plastic material common for 3D printing creates a rigid structure inconsistent with the flexible material of fish fins.  To alleviate this inconsistency, the intention is to utilize resin material to print appropriately dimensioned fish fins mirroring the pectoral fins of the mola mola or triggerfish.

\section{Discussion}
\subsection{What We Learned}
\subsection{Underwater Considerations}
Throughout our research and simulation development this semester, we have learned about the complexities surrounding underwater vehicle modeling and experimentation. One of the first considerations for this project was that since we are looking to increase UUV maneuverability at low speeds, we would have to designate what exactly constitutes low speed. The advance ratio is a non-dimensional parameter that relates the speed of a vehicle through a fluid to the size and rotational speed of its propeller. We determined that an advance ratio under 0.35 would constitute low speed. Additionally, we looked into the possibility of bollard condition affecting our experimentation as fins complete the rowing motion.  At bollard condition, the speed of the UUV is approximately zero.  This ensures the fin use for directionality only, allowing the propeller to be the sole source of velocity.  The angle of attack of the fins will equal the angle the torpedo is holding at the bollard condition.  Developing a sound understanding of the bollard condition facilitates knowledge of the force generated from the flapping fins.  The net force for the fin is the power stroke force plus the recovery stroke force.  Because the force from the power stroke exceeds that of the recovery stroke, net force is in the direction of the power stroke.  The presence of lift and drag forces as a function of attack angle complicate the bollard condition and require more research for sound comprehension.  The bollard condition is applied to the toy sim will be useful for 3-axis hardware experimentation.  etc etc

We also could not assume neutral buoyancy as we can in modeling. As we develop our test rig, it is likely that the submerged volume and mass will change. We began planning for what would be the easiest way to achieve neutral buoyancy and came up with foam-filling as previously mentioned. 

\subsection{Simulation}
Simulating a UUV with fins is a complex process reliant on accurate, representative equations of the forces acting on vehicles underwater. Our project is primarily concerned with the effect of thrust forces on the UUV body created by fins. This requires a process of researching applicable drag coefficients, implementing equations, accounting for forces and moments, and determining which outputs will tell us the fins are adding maneuverability to the UUV. This is an ongoing process with plenty room for additional considerations and development.

\subsection{Fin Design}
The design of the fins for our project are inspired by the fins of the mentioned mola mola and triggerfish. We have been familiarizing ourselves with 3D printing and creating CAD files. However, an important attribute of fish fins is their ability to introduce flexure. Flexural stiffness in fins can affect the propulsive and agility capabilities of fish. Optimized stiffness typically result from non-uniform fin profiles with stiff leading edges. Achieving this in a 3D printed fin is difficult and has led us to resin printing. We hope to implement flexure in our test fins using its capabilities of adhesion control and increased precision.

\begin{itemize}
\item Actuator testing
\item Testing on free, cylindrical body
\item \textbf{Use of Hopper Hall SURF} 
\item Synergy with turtle fin \textbf{amphibious} effort
\item Initial \textbf{instrumented smart fin}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Control of fin stroke}
If we consider a complete fin stroke as a trajectory through the control map, \textbf{can we use variational methods to find an ``optimal'' stroke?}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Highest force} production in a desired direction
\item \textbf{Most efficient} in a desired direction
\item \textbf{Least movement} for a required force
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Challenges Going Forward}
Going forward next semester, we want to finish our UUV model and experimentally validate some of our findings through a 3-axis test rig. We want to determine whether our optimized fin designs and actuation holds up in testing. We also want to develop a control algorithm for our fin system that relates fin actuation to a desired direction. If we successfully develop this algorithm, we will be able to effect UUV movement in specified directions. This will make the UUV highly maneuverable. Simulation challenges include creating a control algorithm connecting fins to directional commands, accurate thrust calculation and finding appropriate drag coefficients. Experimental challenges include power supply in an underwater environment, effective implementation of fins to produce maneuverability data, COVID-related lab limitations, accurate sensing and adequate data compiling.
