% for stuff from 502 you want me to add in just tell me what sections/pages from your 502 reports and I'll get them in here and then smooth them over

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Toy model}
\subsection{3-axis test rig}
\subsection{Modeling of the base UUV}
% If you want to use a figure provide me with .png or .jpg or whatever and I can put it in. For a table put it in comments and I can format for you. 
\subsection{Actuator designs}
% Do you want me to use your sketches from your poster directory?
